# 2020-Presidential-Election-Predictor (last update 10-29-2020)
If the election were held today, what are the odds that a democrat wins the Electoral College.

odds of dem win = 86.0%   
mean = 307 electoral votes   
standard deviation = 35.0

If Rep is given Texas, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, and Ohio, then Rep is actually favored to win.  Dem is at 48%.

Interestingly, if I put the odds back in for North Carolina with the others above to Rep, then Dem odds increase to 66%.  I believe if Rep loses either Florida or North Carolina, then there is no path to victory for Rep.  Odds have been flipping back and forth on predictit for North Carolina as real voter data is reported.
